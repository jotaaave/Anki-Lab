# Anki-Lab :book::toolbox:

### This project is a flashcard-based platform designed for rapid learning training, but with more freedom for users. It brings together my favorite study styles into a single system while allowing free modifications. The goal is to integrate it into other applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord.

## Disclaimer:

This project is under development.
Soon, I will be adding more content to the Read.me and details about the updates.
