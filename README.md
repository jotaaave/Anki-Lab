# Anki-Lab 📖🧰

### This project is a flashcard-based platform designed for rapid learning training, but with more freedom for users. It brings together my favorite study styles into a single system while allowing free modifications. The goal is to integrate it into other applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord.
